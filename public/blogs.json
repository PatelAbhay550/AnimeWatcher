        "content": "Record-Breaking Streak Nirmala Sitharaman's seven consecutive budget presentations surpass the previous record held by Morarji Desai, who presented the budget six times in a row. Desai, however, still holds the record for the most budget presentations overall, having presented ten budgets. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram follows with nine presentations, while former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee each presented five consecutive budgets. Key Highlight: The Lok Sabha’s business advisory committee has planned discussions on various critical issues including railways, education, health, MSMEs, and food processing, alongside the Union Budget. A total of 20 hours has been allocated for the debate on the budget. Economic Survey 2023-24: The Economic Survey 2023-24, presented on July 22, outlines the state of the economy over the past year and sets the stage for the upcoming budget. Key takeaways from the survey will likely influence the budget's focus and priorities. Stay tuned for the live updates and detailed highlights of the Union Budget 2024-25.",
